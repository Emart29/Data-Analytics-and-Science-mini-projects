There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"#import library \nimport pandas as pd\nprint('Done')","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":48,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#import library \nimport pandas as pd\nprint('Done')","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1760993599360,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":39,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"92a53fb5-83bb-477b-a7e3-8f0621f1b2a1"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Done\n"}]},{"source":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\nprint('Done Reading CSV')","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":49,"lastExecutedAt":1760993599409,"lastExecutedByKernel":"92a53fb5-83bb-477b-a7e3-8f0621f1b2a1","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\nprint('Done Reading CSV')","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":39,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"2023aee5-e42e-4b17-b682-4b8ff2311088","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Done Reading CSV\n"}],"execution_count":50},{"source":"# Preview the data\nschools.head(5)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":68,"lastExecutedAt":1760993599477,"lastExecutedByKernel":"92a53fb5-83bb-477b-a7e3-8f0621f1b2a1","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Preview the data\nschools.head(5)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":501,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"952d526c-af14-4e07-b220-ab4e24b3d1d6","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"bdbda2ed-483f-469c-a42a-f4cbf6b20c17","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"school_name":["New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","Essex Street Academy","Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","Henry Street School for International Studies"],"borough":["Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan"],"building_code":["M022","M445","M445","M445","M056"],"average_math":[657,395,418,613,410],"average_reading":[601,411,428,453,406],"average_writing":[601,387,415,463,381],"percent_tested":[null,78.9,65.1,95.9,59.7]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
